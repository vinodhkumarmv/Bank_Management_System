# Bank_Management_System

ABSTRACT:-

The Bank Account Management System is an application for maintaining a person's account in a
bank. In this project I tried to show the working of a banking account system and cover the basic
functionality of a Bank Account Management System. To develop a project for solving financial
applications of a customer in banking environment in order to nurture the needs of an end
banking user by providing various ways to perform banking tasks. Also, to enable the userâ€™s
work space to have additional functionalities which are not provided under a conventional
banking project.
The Bank Account Management System undertaken as a project is based on relevant
technologies. The main aim of this project is to develop software for Bank Account Management
System. This project has been developed to carry out the processes easily and quickly, which is
not possible with the manuals systems, which are overcome by this software. This project is
developed using Java language. Creating and managing requirements is a challenge of IT,
systems and product development projects or indeed for any activity where you have to manage
a contractual relationship. Organization need to effectively define and manage requirements to
ensure they are meeting needs of the customer, while proving compliance and staying on the
schedule and within budget.
The impact of a poorly expressed requirement can bring a business out of compliance or even
cause injury or death. Requirements definition and management is an activity that can deliver a
high, fast return on investment. The project analyzes the system requirements and then comes up
with the requirements specifications. It studies other related systems and then come up with
system specifications. The system is then designed in accordance with specifications to satisfy
the requirements. The system design is then implemented with Java. The system is designed as
an interactive and content management system. The content management system deals with data
entry, validation confirm and updating whiles the interactive system deals with system
interaction with the administration and users. Thus, above features of this project will save
transaction time and therefore increase the efficiency of the system 

Technologies used:

Frontend - JAVA

Backend  - MySQL Using XAMPP server
